Post PhD Dule work in progress:

<ul>
  <li> There are several papers inside my <a href="dule.html">Ph.D.</a>
  waiting to be let out. I'd gladly welcome collaboration in
  tidying up, extending and publishing the results. 
  Below are some paper ideas and drafts.</li>

  <li>In this paper about <a href="download/dule-papers/anonymous.pdf">
  anonymous (co)inductive types inside modules</a> 
  we should disregard polymorphism via polytypism 
  and insert a sketch of formal semantics.</li>
  <li>Analyze in which cases <a href="download/dule-papers/anonymous.pdf">
  polymorphism via polytypism</a> actually works and why. No need to stick
  to Dule here.</li>
  <li>Compare the lambda calculi with labels developed for OCaml
  with <a href="download/dule-papers/fooldule.ps"> my calculus</a>.</li>
  <li>Compare my categorical notation for the core language
  with lambda calculi with explicit substitutions.
  Find extensions or typed versions of Curien's Categorical Combinators
  and compare with my reduction system. However, as soon as 
  (co)inductive combinators enter the arena, this is probably too much work 
  (too large theories).</li>
  <li>Compare my LCC categories with Context Categories and their 
  generalizations. Try to axiomatize my almost-2-categories 
  and/or compare them with others. Present my 2-categorical setup 
  with mixed variance as a 2-dimensional doctrine 
  and/or co-Kleisli category, etc.
  Perhaps wait for axioms in module specifications, as they will require
  an indexed category, a fibration or another scary thing
  on top of all my current stuff, anyway. </li>
  <li>Show that in some (most?) papers and books about lambda calculus
  the theory of coproducts is not as strong as categorical theory,
  despite some papers and books claiming otherwise. My theory is OK,
  probably due to explicit substitutions/categorical composition
  and verification by adjunctions.
  <li> Try to sensibly describe Dule as
  <a href="download/dule-papers/trends.pdf"> 
  an ongoing project in module system design</a>,
  and provide some more rationale for the design decisions
  and comparison with other ideologies.</li>
  <li> Sell the (co)inductive modules somehow. Perhaps allow folds 
  over the modules' types, first. Anyway, before that, write a paper
  about <a href="download/dule-papers/scm-llncs.pdf">
  the Simple Category of Modules</a>; an update of <a href="http://proglang.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IFL2007/proceedings.shtml"> 
  the one I presented at IFL2007</a>. Perhaps the nicest thing in there,
  is the representation of sharing equations as limits (with the proof that 
  enough limits exist).</li>
  <li> Revisit the countless open problems listed in the Final Remarks 
  section of my Ph.D. Some of them are easy, others look almost done... :)</li>
</ul>
