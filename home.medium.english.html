I preserve with solicitude
<a href="home.old.english.html">my old home page (1995)</a>,
from the times, when I was a student at
<a href="http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/english">MIMUW</a>.

<p>

Now, I'm a young scientist, taking part in the activities of the
<a href="http://zls.mimuw.edu.pl/index.e.php">Applied Logic Group</a>.

<p>

Today I belong to the Roman Catholic community

<p>

Sometimes I

pray at the Faculty</a>.

I'm working on
<a href="dule.html">Dule</a>
--- a categorical module system and a programming language.

<p>

I'm still responsible for the
<a href="ftp/EMLKit/README.html">EML Kit</a> project.

<p>

Some time ago I had programmed
<a href="ftp/Dijkstra/README.html">
a toy interpreter of the Dijkstra's language</a>.

<p>

I've prepared, together with Marcin Benke and Grzegorz Grudzinski,
some teaching materials for the Standard ML labs:
<a href="ftp/TSLS">Tajny Skrypt Lab SML</a>.

Here are <a href="pictures/tata">oil paintings</a> by my Father ---
Stefan Konarski. And here is the <a href="http://www.konarska.pl/">

I would like to declare that I wholeheartedly sympathize with these students
which are harmed by the system of control over the progress with studying.
By giving marks, I myself have become a tool of this system,
but I will not forget that, when I studied, it did not bring me any good.
The opposite, it did cost me much health and took a lot of my precious time
which I intended to spend on learning, and then on research.
I desire with all my might that the internal, noble motivation for studying
become common. At the same time I grieve that people of mature personality,
which could gain and contribute most during studies,
are being especially strongly humiliated, tied and discouraged
by the system of forcing to learn.
