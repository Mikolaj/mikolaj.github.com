<title>The EML Kit</title>

<h1>The EML Kit</h1>

The EML Kit aims to be (the basis and test-bed for) a comfortable
framework for the formal development of programs, using the
<a href="http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/%7Edts/eml/">
Extended ML</a> language, formalism and methodology.

<p><hr><p>

Version 1.1 is a complete implementation of the Extended ML
seen as a 'programming language'. It allows for parsing, type-checking
and evaluation of arbitrary EML code, be it pure
<a href="http://foxnet.cs.cmu.edu/sml.html"> Standard ML</a>
or full-blown EML with its axioms and other specification constructs.
All of this is done in a strict adherence to the formally defined EML Syntax,
Static Semantics and Dynamic Semantics, as of the EML Definition,
version 1.15 + 0.2i. See the file
<a href="CHANGES">CHANGES</a> for a list of changes
to the EML Kit from version 1.0 to 1.1.

<p>

Now, there is a great need for an "implementation"
of the EML Verification Semantics. We hope the EML Kit will help in
as well as benefit from the current work on the EML proof theory,
proof obligation generators, prototype provers, etc.

Yet, as for now only the syntax and type correctness of
axioms is checked by the EML Kit - there is no extra aid
in proving them correct, sufficient or whatever.

<p>

A big step towards this goal is The EML Kit Proof Obligations Generator -
an extension of EML Kit 1.1. It comes with Graphical Pretty Printer
for Proof Obligations - an X Window-based browser for proof obligations.

The development of the EML Kit has been partially supported by
KBN (Polish State Research Committee) grants
"<a href="http://wwwat.mimuw.edu.pl/~tarlecki/kbn93grant/index.html">
Formal Methods of Software Development</a>" and
"<a href="http://wwwat.mimuw.edu.pl/~tarlecki/kbn96grant/index.html">
Logical Aspects of Software Specification and Development Methods</a>".

<p><hr><p>

The EML Kit is based on the
<a href="http://www.diku.dk/research-groups/topps/activities/mlkit.html">
ML Kit</a>; a flexible, clean and modularized interpreter
of the Standard ML, written in Standard ML.

The EML Kit is no longer maintained.
